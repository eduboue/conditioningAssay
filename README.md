# README for scripts driving a conditioning assay
## Overview
   All scripts as of now written in MATLAB
   Requires Image Processing Toolbox and Image aquisition toolbox, as well as PsycToolBox and arduino addon
   The program requires two computers, which interface with one another via arduino boards (uno)
   Arduino boards are really slow, so this will change to NI DAQ soon
   MASTER drives visual input 
   SLAVE drives camera
